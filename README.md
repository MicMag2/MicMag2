# Welcome to the MicMag2 official repository

MicMag2 is an combined atomsitic and micromagnetic simulation package. The core programm was originally named MicroMagnum, while a lot of expansions was implemented by the MicMag2 contributors (see AUTHORS for more details).


## Features

MicMag2 provides CPU and CPU multithreading support as well as float and double GPU support for most of the packages.
You can run LLG equations of micromagnetic problems and can include SOT STT extensions.
Interesting Modules, such as CurrentPath calculation, Higher order anisotropy and angle-dependent SOT are included. 
More modules are under active developement.
Please have a look at the examples folder if you are interested in the syntax.
Installation instructions are available in INSTALL file.
